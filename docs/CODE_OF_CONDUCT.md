# Code of Conduct

## Be Kind

- Don't be mean.
- Insulting anyone is prohibited.
- Harassment of any kind is prohibited.
- If another person feels uncomfortable with your remarks, stop it.
- If a moderator deems your comment or conduct as inappropriate, stop it.
- Disagreeing is fine, but keep it to technical arguments. Never attack the person.
- Give the benefit of the doubt. Assume good intentions.
- Show empathy. There are 3 interpretations to any message: what we thought, what we said, and what they understand.
- This does mean we exclude people who are not kind. We are happy to make that sacrifice.

## Or Else

- Violations of the Code of Conduct will result in 1 warning.
- If the violation is major, a moderator may just ban immediately.
- If a warning has already been given, a moderator will ban the offender.
- There is no process for appealing a ban.
- Any violations can be reported to to the principal maintainer ([@joseluisq](https://github.com/joseluisq)) on either [Keybase](https://keybase.io/joseluisq) (preferred) or [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VWvtZeWAA7).
