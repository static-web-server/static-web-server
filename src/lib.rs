//! # Static Web Server (SWS)
//!
//! SWS is a cross-platform, high-performance and asynchronous web server for static files-serving.
//!
//! **Considerations:**
//!
//! This crate was published to make it possible for users to embed SWS with ease instead of working around it via forks.
//! For example, allowing users to turn off default features like `tls` and so on.
//!
//! **However**, because the library is highly coupled with the SWS binary project at this point,
//! users might be limited by the exposed APIs, implementations, missing functionality, or dependencies.
//!
//! In the future, we will eventually plan to make SWS library independent from the binary project.
//!
//! That said, if fine-grained control and flexibility are needed then you could want to look at other alternatives like HTTP libraries or frameworks.
//!
//! **Pre-compile binaries:**
//!
//! This is the official SWS crate.
//! If you are looking for platform pre-compile binaries then
//! take a look at [static-web-server.net/download-and-install](https://static-web-server.net/download-and-install).
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! **Static Web Server** (or **`SWS`** abbreviated) is a very small and fast production-ready web server suitable to serve static web files or assets.
//!
//! It is focused on **lightness and easy-to-use** principles while keeping [high performance and safety](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html) powered by [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org).
//!
//! Written on top of [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) and [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) runtime. It provides [concurrent and asynchronous networking abilities](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/02_why_async.html) as well as the latest HTTP/1 - HTTP/2 implementations.
//!
//! It's cross-platform and available for `Linux`, `macOS`, `Windows` and `FreeBSD` (`x86`/`x86_64`,  `ARM`/`ARM64`) as well as `Docker`.

//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Built with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) which is focused on [safety, speed and concurrency](https://kornel.ski/rust-c-speed).
//! - Memory safe and very reduced CPU and RAM overhead.
//! - Blazing fast static files-serving and asynchronous powered by latest [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/), [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and a set of [awesome crates](https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server/blob/master/Cargo.toml).
//! - Single __4MB__ (uncompressed) and fully static binary with no dependencies ([Musl libc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html)). Suitable for running on [any Linux distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) or [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/joseluisq/static-web-server/tags).
//! - Optional GZip, Deflate or Brotli compression for text-based web files only.
//! - Compression on-demand via [Accept-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) header.
//! - [Partial Content Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_serving) support for byte-serving of large files.
//! - Optional [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) headers for assets.
//! - [Termination signal](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html) handling with [graceful shutdown](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices-terminating-with-grace) ability and grace period.
//! - [HTTP/2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) and TLS support.
//! - [Security headers](https://web.dev/security-headers/) for HTTP/2 by default.
//! - [HEAD](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2) responses.
//! - Lightweight and configurable logging via [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) crate.
//! - Customizable number of worker threads.
//! - Optional directory listing.
//! - [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) support.
//! - Basic HTTP Authentication.
//! - Customizable HTTP response headers for specific file requests via glob patterns.
//! - Fallback pages for 404 errors, useful for Single-page applications.
//! - Run the server as a [Windows Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc783643(v=ws.10)).
//! - Configurable using CLI arguments, environment variables or a TOML file.
//! - Default and custom error pages.
//! - Custom URL rewrites and redirects via glob patterns.
//! - Support for serving pre-compressed (Gzip/Brotli) files.
//! - First-class [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) support. [Scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) and latest [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) Docker images.
//! - Ability to accept a socket listener as a file descriptor for use in sandboxing and on-demand applications (E.g [systemd](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html)).
//! - Cross-platform. Pre-compiled binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows and FreeBSD (`x86`,`x86_64`,`ARM`,`ARM64`).
//!
//! ## Cargo features
//!
//! When building from the source, all features are enabled by default.
//! However, you can disable just the ones you don't need from the lists below.
//!
